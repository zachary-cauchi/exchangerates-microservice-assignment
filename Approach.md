# Approach

Based on the 'eShopOnContainers' microservices example provided by Microsoft.

## Roadmap 0

Implemented a basic MSSQL database setup with migrations and data-seeding.
The server is minimally set up for now but will incorporate better logging functionality soon.
The server and database are both hosted in docker containers and created using a docker-compose file.
